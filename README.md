> # Presentation React App
### Live Demo :  [Go to Presentation app](https://react-presentations.netlify.app)


Developed a presentation making website UI using React and Tailwind CSS with a mobile-first responsive design approach, so it looks great on any device. Designed a responsive navbar with toggle menu, search bar icon, and scrollspy functionality for improved user experience.
To make the website even more interactive, I implemented multiple components using grid and flexbox layouts. Additionally, I used Framer Motion, an open-source motion library for React made by Framer, to build animations.
